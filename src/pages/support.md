# Developer Support

## Forum

For developer support type of requests, we encourage developers to use our [forum](https://experienceleaguecommunities.adobe.com/t5/project-firefly/ct-p/project-firefly). 

## Bugs and feature requests

In addition, feature requests or bugs can be submitted on our public repositories – [CLI repo](https://github.com/adobe/aio-cli) and [SDK repo]( https://github.com/adobe/aio-sdk). Enterprise Customer support is not available during the “Developer Preview” phase.

You can achieve the same directly from the [CLI](https://github.com/adobe/aio-cli). The `aio report` command will open for you an issue for a new bug or feature request against the CLI [main repository](https://github.com/adobe/aio-cli), by respectively using the `-b` or `-f` flags, or the `--bug` or `--feature` options.

We will take care of the triage and move the new issue to the most appropriate repository, all of them being open sourced.

App Builder Trial FAQ
**I do not use Adobe Experience Cloud products like Adobe Analytics, Adobe Experience Manager, Adobe Campaign or others, can I still try App Builder?**

No. App Builder is built specifically for users of Adobe Experience Cloud so you will need to have access to at least one Experience Cloud product to be accepted into the trial.

**Do I need any special information I need to apply?**

Yes. You will need the Adobe Identity Management Service (IMS) Orginzation Name and ID. This is the org you use to login to Adobe Experience Cloud. You can retrieve your Organization ID and name from [Adobe Admin Console](https://adminconsole.adobe.com), the ID is part of the URL, the numbers and letters prior to @AdobeOrg) and the name is listed in the top-right corner

If you are unable to access the Adobe Admin Console you will need to ask a sys admin for the org ID and Name in order to apply for a trial.

**Do I need a special role within my company to request a trial?**

In order to login to Admin Console you need to have access to manage your IMS Org. This means you will need to be a sys admin or some sort of administrator for your org (product admin, etc.) 

Once your organization has been onboarded, anyone who has a Developer Role or System Administrator permissions will be able to create projects for App Builder in the [Developer Console](/console)

If you are unable to access the Adobe Admin Console you will need to ask a sys admin for the org ID and Name in order to apply for a trial.

**Can I use this with Creative Cloud or Document Cloud?**

Out of the box, App Builder is currently focused on use cases for Adobe Experience Cloud solutions. As such we have SDKs that make developing for Experience Cloud much easier. 

**How do I find a sys admin for my org?**

This is likely the person who gave you access to login to the Adobe Experience Cloud. This could be someone in your company IT department or in your marketing team.

**Is there a cost for the trial?**

No. The trial is free to use for the duration of the trial period.

**How do I get support during the trial period?**

For trial customers please use our [Experience League forum](https://experienceleaguecommunities.adobe.com/t5/project-firefly/ct-p/project-firefly) to get support.

**How long does it take to get access**

Usually it takes between 1 and 3 days. It may take longer depending on the number of requests we have.

**How can I check if my org is already onboarded to the trial?**

Just visit the Adobe [Developer Console](/console). If you have the button "create project from template" next to the button "create new project" then you are provisioned for App Builder.

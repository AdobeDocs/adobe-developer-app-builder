# How to Get Access to Project Firefly

Getting access is a simple two step process. First fill our [request form](https://adobeio.typeform.com/to/obqgRm) and then click through to join the prerelease program. 

The following information is needed:
* Your Adobe organization ID and organization name. We are granting access to organizations, not to individuals. You can retrieve your Organization ID and name from [Adobe Admin Console](https://adminconsole.adobe.com), the ID is part of the URL (something like some_hash@AdobeOrg) and the name is listed in the top-right corner
* Describe your use case. For example: “I want to extend/integrate Adobe Experience Platform” or “Adobe Experience Manager”

Once your organization has been onboarded, anyone who has a Developer Role or System Administrator permissions will be able to create projects for Firefly in the [Developer Console](https://console.adobe.io)

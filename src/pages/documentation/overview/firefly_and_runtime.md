# Project Firefly and Adobe I/O Runtime
 
Project Firefly greatly simplifies the process of building Cloud Native Applications that leverage Adobe I/O Runtime. 

If you have existing actions deployed on Adobe I/O Runtime and you want to migrate them to a Firefly application (maybe a headless application) these are the main steps:
* In the [Developer Console](https://console.adobe.io) create a new project and choose Project Firefly as the template
* Configure the Adobe CLI and then use it to initialize a new application for the project youâ€™ve created in the Developer Console; check [Setting Up Your Environment](../getting_started/setup.md)
* Create copies of your existing actions in this project
* Deploy and test the new actions
* Update your applications to point to the new actions
 
## Developer Preview and Production SLA
 
If you are a customer who uses Adobe I/O Runtime in production (with production SLAs) and plan on using Project Firefly, you might wonder what the Firefly Developer Preview and I/O Runtime production SLA mean. Any I/O Runtime action you deploy as part of your Firefly projects is also covered by the overall production SLA you have for I/O Runtime.

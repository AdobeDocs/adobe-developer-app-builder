### Fast custom app design

Build custom apps that interact with core Adobe services, and automate processes with event-based integrations. Access authentication services, end-user access controls, the ability to publish/consume custom events, data storage, CI/CD pipelines. UI design is made easy with React Spectrum components that match the look and feel of Adobe’s products.

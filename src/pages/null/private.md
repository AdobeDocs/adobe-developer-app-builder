# Private Distribution

Distribute apps to other members in your Adobe organization.

## Overview

Privately distributed apps are only available to users in the developer's organization and can be accessed via the [App Builder Catalog](https://experience.adobe.com/#/@adobeio/custom-apps). These apps are submitted via the [Developer Console](https://developer.adobe.com/console) and reviewed by admins of the developer's organization.

See [Publishing Your First App Builder Application](../../getting_started/publish_app.md) for a thorough walkthrough on this topic.

> Note: In order for your app to show up in the App Builder Catalog, it must be an Experience Cloud Shell extension.

# Getting Started with Adobe I/O Runtime

Adobe I/O Runtime provides an easy way to run event-driven code on demand on Adobe Experience Cloud and integrate it with Adobe's cloud services, without the effort of managing servers and the expense of always-on computing resources.  

## Getting access

### With App Builder

Adobe I/O Runtime is part of Adobe App Builder. Adobe customers and partners who want to try Adobe I/O Runtime along with storage, custom events, and other App Builder features may sign up for an [App Builder trial](https://developer.adobe.com/app-builder/trial/).

### By purchase or trial

Runtime is also available for purchase by current Adobe enterprise customers or as a six-month trial. Please visit our [getting access](../overview/getting_access.md) page for more details. 

Once you have access to Runtime, you can log into the Adobe I/O Console, create a new project, and add Runtime to them. All actions you run on Runtime are executed within a namespace associated with a project. When you create your new project, you'll get an authorization key that you can use to create and manage your actions.

Once you have an authorization key and an integration with a namespace created, you'll need to install the OpenWhisk CLI. Then, you can get started building applications on the system:

* [Setting up your environment](setup.md)
* [Deploy and invoke your first action](deploy.md)
* [Retrieve Action Invocation Results](activations.md)null

# App Builder and Adobe I/O Runtime

App Builder greatly simplifies the process of building Cloud Native Applications that leverage Adobe I/O Runtime. 

If you have existing actions deployed on Adobe I/O Runtime and you want to migrate them to an App Builder application (for example, a headless application) these are the main steps:

* In the [Developer Console](/console) create a new project and choose App Builder as the template
* Configure the Adobe CLI and then use it to initialize a new application for the project youâ€™ve created in the Developer Console; check [Setting Up Your Environment](../getting_started/index.md)
* Create copies of your existing actions in this project
* Deploy and test the new actions
* Update your applications to point to the new action
*

## 1: Project approvals (Console Part)

Once you have completed development on your project, and deploy your app in the Production workspace,your application is ready for approval. 

**Project Firefly applications:** Projects built using the Project Firefly template are built by an organization for use within that organization. Therefore, Firefly applications require approvals by the enterprise organization administrator only. 
    
### Project Firefly applications approval process

Once you have completed development on a Project Firefly application, it is time to submit the application to your administrators for review and approval.

The final app is based on the *Production* workspace, therefore it is important to ensure that the production workspace contains all of the necessary APIs, Events, and Runtime code that it needs before submitting for approval.

To begin the approval process, navigate to the *Production* workspace and select **Submit for approval** in the top-right corner of the screen or select **Approval** in the left navigation.

Once the submission details have been completed, select **Submit** to begin the approval process.

Following a review by your organization administrators, your application will either be approved and published or rejected. If the application is rejected, your admin will be able to include a note telling you what went wrong, allowing you to fix the error and submit for approval again.

From console side, once an application has been approved, either by internal reviewers or the Adobe Review team, its *Status* will be updated to "Published" and the application will be available for use either by employees within your enterprise organization (for Project Firefly applications) or for the general public through Adobe Exchange.

# Publishing your headless Project Firefly App

The `Project Firefly Apps` [Adobe Experience Cloud](https://experience.adobe.com) only lists Project Firefly Apps that are SPAs. If you publish a headless app, please refer to our code lab [Your First Headless App with Project Firefly](https://adobeio-codelabs-barcode-adobedocs.project-helix.page/?src=/README.html).

We might provide supplementary discoverability mechanisms for published headless apps in future Project Firefly releases.

Developers can distribute their App Builder apps privately or publicly.

## Private

Privately distributed apps are only available to members of the developer's organization. See [Private Distribution](./private.md) for more details. 

## Public 

Publicly distributed apps are available for install via Adobe Exchange. See [Public Distribution](./public.md) for details on how to configure and prepare your app for public distribution.

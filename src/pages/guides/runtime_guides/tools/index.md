# Runtime Tools

The most important tools for working with Adobe I/O Runtime are:

- [aio CLI](cli_install.md) to manage namespaces and authentication for the `aio` CLI
- [wsk CLI](wsk_install.md), the main interface for managing actions, packages, rules, and triggers, and to get access to activation results, errors, and logs
- [wskdeploy CLI](wskdeploy_install.md) to deploy multiple actions and packages

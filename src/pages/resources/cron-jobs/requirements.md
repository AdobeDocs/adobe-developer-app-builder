<Requirements/>

## Codelab environment

Please note that, the alarms package mentioned in this lab is only available in Adobe I/O Runtime environment. In other words, you need to run and deploy your app with either of these commands: `aio app run` or `aio app deploy`. You will not be able to use it in the local standalone OpenWhisk deployment, which comes with `aio app run --local`.

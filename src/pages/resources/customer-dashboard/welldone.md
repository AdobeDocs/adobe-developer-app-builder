# Well done

Congratulations, you've reached the end.

## Achievements

In this codelab, you have learned:
* How to **bootstrap** a new App Builder app using Adobe Campaign Standard template
* What is **inside a App Builder app**
* How to **run** the app locally, and **deploy** it onto the App Builder platform
* How to leverage **IMS user profile** from Adobe Experience Cloud Shell to call Campaign Standard APIs
* How to use **React Spectrum** to display a simple list of customer profiles on the **app UI**
* How to use the external signal API to start a **custom workflow** in Campaign Standard, powered by an Adobe I/O Runtime action

The use case presented in this codelab is particularly useful for extensions of Adobe Campaign Standard, or integrating Campaign Standard with external systems such as Point of Sale (POS), CRM (Microsoft Dynamics, Salesforce), and so on.

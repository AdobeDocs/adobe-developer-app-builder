# Build AEM Asset Compute Worker with Photoshop API

Many rendition requirements such as converting to formats and resizing images are addressed by Processing Profiles in Experience Manager as a Cloud Service (AEMaaCS). More complex business requirements may need a custom-created solution that suits an organizationâ€™s needs. Asset Compute Service can be extended by creating custom applications that are called from Processing Profiles in Experience Manager. These custom applications cater to the supported use cases.

With the support of Photoshop APIs, that becomes even easier. The Photoshop magics are now available on the cloud, at scale. It helps to automate repetitive design tasks and keep your team doing what they do best.

This codelab will show you how to build an AEM Assets Compute Worker using App Builder and Photoshop APIs to generate custom image renditions.

For your convenience, we provide a sample project as the result of this codelab at [AdobeDocs/adobeio-samples-assets-compute-photoshop](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/adobeio-samples-assets-compute-photoshop).

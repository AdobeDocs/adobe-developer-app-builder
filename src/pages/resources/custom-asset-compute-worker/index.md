> This Code Lab is based on the [How to generate intelligent renditions with AEM as a Cloud Service][original-post] blog post.

Image resizing or format conversion is a relatively easy task when doing renditions in **Adobe Experience Manager**. 
Your project may require more robust approaches supported by intelligent image services, for example to change images to greyscale, or intelligently crop  images around faces. 

This Code Lab will guide you through the creating a [custom worker for Asset Compute][asset-compute-extensions] using App Builder, and using it in [Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud service][aem-cloud].
